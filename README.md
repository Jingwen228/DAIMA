covQTLs are a series of genes that coordinate and govern development of plant organs and whole biomass. Here, we expand a new mapping model based on functional mapping to detect covariation quantitative trait loci (QTLs), which, via a series of hypothesis tests, allows quantification of how QTLs regulate covariation between organ growth and biomass accumulation.(leaf2.txt and dry weight.txt are used as the original phenotypic data; m.snp.txt is used as gene marker data; data.lw.R is used as raw data processing;data.curve.R and data.est are used as hypothesis tests; data.test.R is used as main program.)
